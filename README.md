In today's competitive retail and supply chain environment, efficient coordination between
warehouses, suppliers, and retail operations is crucial. Many small to medium-sized
businesses struggle with managing inventory levels, processing customer orders, and tracking
shipments effectively due to manual or disconnected systems. This results in stockouts,
delivery delays, and poor customer experience. The proposed Warehouse Operation and
Retail Management System (WORMS) aims to streamline and automate key business
processes including inventory tracking, order management, customer handling, supplier
coordination, and shipment tracking. By integrating these operations into a centralized
database system, WORMS will improve data accuracy, enable real-time updates, and support
better decision-making for warehouse and retail managers.
